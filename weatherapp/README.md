# Weather Forecast App 

This Flutter weather app provides real-time weather information based on the user's location or a location they specify. It uses the [openWeathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/) API to fetch weather data, including current conditions and forecasts. The app's user-friendly interface and intuitive design make it easy for users to stay updated on the weather conditions in their area or any other location they're interested in. Built with Flutter and Dart.
